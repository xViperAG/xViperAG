## ðŸ’¬ About [xViperAG](https://github.com/xViperAG) 
ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm xViperAG, and I am an active developer for YggdrasilRP, as well as a maintainer for QR RedM and owner of Morningstar Development.

I started doing development work back in 2022, when I was looking to find a new server and wanted to start fresh, and with the knowledge that I had gained as I started working on my major in Computer Science in '21, I decided to kick start my journey from there.
